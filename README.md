Create a new GitHub repository and add a file named README.md.

Your README.md file should include all of the following:

i. The IP address and SSH port so your server can be accessed by the reviewer.

ii. The complete URL to your hosted web application.

iii. A summary of software you installed and configuration changes made.

iv. A list of any third-party resources you made use of to complete this project.

Open your ~/.ssh/udacity_key.rsa file in a text editor and copy the contents of that file.

During the submission process, paste the contents of the udacity_key.rsa file into the "Notes to Reviewer" field.
